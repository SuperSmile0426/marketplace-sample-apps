### Procedure to run the app:

1. You can locally test your Omni App only one Product at a time. For example,
   if you want to test your app on Freshworks CRM, you will have to mention the
   `"freshworks_crm"` product attribute first in your `manifest.json` and vice
   versa.
2. Open the relavant page in any of the product that Omni App supports(In this
   case Freshsales and Freshworks CRM). In the bottom viewport you will see your
   app running.
