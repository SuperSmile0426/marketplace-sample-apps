## Conditional ticket properties

  The Conditional ticket properties app lets admin hide the default type field from the ticket details page. Additionally, based on the ticket priority chosen, admin is able to hide the close button, restricting the edition of due date, disable type, group, impact ticket properties & as well add a default private note. This app also hides the urgency and impact properties if the logged in agent is from the HR group.

  Conditional ticket properties app demonstrates -

  1. Rendering apps on Ticket details page (background location)
  2. Usage of Global data APIs
  3. Usage of Events and Interface APIs on ticket details page
