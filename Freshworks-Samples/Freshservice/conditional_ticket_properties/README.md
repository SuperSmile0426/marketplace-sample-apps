# Conditional ticket properties

## Description

 The Conditional ticket properties app lets admin hide the default type field from the ticket details page. Additionally, based on the ticket priority chosen, admin is able to hide the close button, restricting the edition of due date, disable type, group, impact ticket properties & as well add a default private note. This app also hides the urgency and impact properties if the logged in agent is from the HR group.

## Notes

* you cannot see the app itself as it is running in the ticket details page's background. you can refer [manifest.json](./manifest.json) on how it is implemented.

* update the ticket properties mentioned in this app (such as priority) to see how the UI is changing.

* create a new requester with department HR to view how other parts of the app works.
    >You can create a requester in the following way:
    go to admin -> user management -> requesters -> new requester(top right hand corner)
