# Dynamic Installation Page âœ¨

## Description

This sample app demonstrates how iparam callbacks can be used to enable custom validation and make the installation parameters much more dynamic. This approach cuts the need for custom installation parameters and leverages the simplicity and power of standard iparams (iparams.json).

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a trial Freshdesk account created
2. A properly configured [Development environment](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/quick-start/) along with the [FDK (Freshworks Development Kit)](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/freshworks-cli/).

## Procedure to run the app

1. Run the app locally using the [`fdk run`](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/freshworks-cli/#run) command.
2. Go to `http://localhost:10001/custom_configs` in your browser to test the installation page.
3. You can add new callback functions associated with iparam fields in `iparams.json` by specifying the callback name & in `iparams.js`by defining the corresponding callback function.
4. You can also modify the code directly in the `iparams.js` file to see the changes in the Installation pages.

> Disclaimer: The use of mock servers in production environment is disallowed. HttpBin.org can be used to debug or test your app's behavior locally. However, this will not work when the app is deployed in a live account. We recommend switching to a middleware controlled by you in such scenarios.
> AWS Cloud, Google Cloud, Heroku offer a generous free-tier.
