## Show Ticket and Associated Details

  The  Show Ticket and Associated Details app leverages the data APIs in the ticket details page to show additional relevant information about the ticket. Based on the selection from the dropdown, an agent can now get more context about few of the aspects like (and not limiting to) the requester, ticket associations such as Problem, Change, Assets etc.

  The app demonstrates - 

  1. Rendering apps on Ticket details page (sidebar location).
  2. Usage of Data APIs for Ticket details page.
