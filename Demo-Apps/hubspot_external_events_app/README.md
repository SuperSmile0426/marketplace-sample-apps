## Hubspot-Freshdesk Contacts Sync App

  This app creates a contact in Freshdesk every time a contact is created in Hubspot and also creates a contact in Hubspot everytime a contact is created in Freshdesk (bidirectional). So the contacts created in Hubspot or Freshdesk are always in sync with each other.

  This app demonstrates the following features
  1. Using App Setup events to create and delete Hubspot webhoook
  2. Responding to the Hubspot webhook using external events
  3. Making an API request in server.js
