# Contributing to Freshworks Sample Apps

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make AngularJS even better than it is
today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/freshdesk/marketplace-sample-apps/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD)
* [Questions and Problems](#question)
* [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
* [Feature Requests](#feature)
* [Improving Documentation](#docs)
* [Issue Submission Guidelines](#submit)
* [Pull Request Submission Guidelines](#submit-pr)
* [Hacktoberfest 2020](#hacktoberfest)

## <a name="requests"></a> Questions, Bugs, Features

### <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?


Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports, feature requests and open-source contributions. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on dedicated

support platforms, the best being our dedicated [developer forum](https://community.developers.freshworks.com/).

Freshworks Developer Community is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there is a dedicated team monitoring forum to help you as soon as possible
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help
  someone else
- The community can help you if they have faced a similar issue before

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general
support and redirect people to the section you are reading right now.

### <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue or Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our
GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Please see the [Submission Guidelines](#submit) below.**

### <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue or creating a post via [developer forum](https://community.developers.freshworks.com/).

### <a name="docs"></a> Want a Doc Fix?

Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an issue and outline the problem
or improvement you have - however, creating the doc fix yourself is much better!

If you want to help improve the docs, it's a good idea to let others know what you're working on to
minimize duplication of effort. Create a new issue (or comment on a related existing one) to let
others know what you're working on.

If you're making a small change (typo, phrasing) don't worry about filing an issue first. Use the
friendly blue "Improve this doc" button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository
in-place and make a quick change on the fly. The commit message is preformatted to the right type
and scope, so you only have to add the description.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the PR to be sure you
haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues. 

## <a name="submit"></a> Issue Submission Guidelines
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize
the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

In general, providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt
with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **FDK Version(s)** - is it a regression?
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only specific ones?
* **Steps to Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Plunker][plunker] or
  [JSFiddle][jsfiddle]) or an unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> PR Submission Guidelines
- Search for an open or closed pull request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort :) !
- Read our [Code Review Guidelines](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/code-review-guidelines/) and make sure that the changes/sample apps adhere to it.
- Please test and send a GitHub pull request with a clear list of what you've done. It is recommended that you test the apps by [installing the FDK](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/quick-start/) and [running them](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/quick-start/#test_your_app) in the corresponding Freshworks product with coverage > 80%.
- Pull Requests will be reviewed and suggestions(if any) will be provided as early as possible.
- Once the suggestions(if any) are incorporated,changes will be merged.

### <a name="hacktoberfest"></a> Hacktoberfest

Assuming you might already know about Hacktoberfest and learning to build an entire app can be time consuming. We created some tasks as issues for you to simply gain some familiarity before you choose to invest your time.

We have some of the code samples for the developer community who refer to on a regular basis. So we picked up some small tasks like refactoring and reorganising sample app codes for especially for beginners to make quick Pull requests(PRs).

Try following up the tasks described in the issues. Those would be helpful.


If you prefer bit more challenging tasks, look out for tags those don't have "good first issue" tag. We are hoping to help at least 100 developers make PRs to be one among first 10 PRs in their career this Hacktoberfest 2020.


Try something different this Hacktoberfest. May be contributing to Freshworks App sample?

**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**
