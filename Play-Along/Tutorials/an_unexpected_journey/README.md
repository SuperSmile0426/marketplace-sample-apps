Every time the ticket details page is loaded, check to see if Mr. Baggins is the current agent, and if it is him, set the priority to urgent and disable the priority field. If Mr. Baggins tries to reassign the ticket, show a notification warning him of dire consequences. 
Also make an API request to The Movie Database to search for a movie named "an unexpected journey" and display its overview in a notification.
