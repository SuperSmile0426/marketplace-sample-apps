## Asana Serverless OAuth App

  This app creates a task in Asana for every ticket created in Freshdesk.

  This app demonstrates the following features

  1. OAuth 2.0 - account level OAuth
  2. Making an API request through Request API using oauth tokens to authenticate
  3. Freshdesk Product event - onTicketCreate
  4. Using a custom installation page to dynamically populate dependent fields (workspace, project)

### Prerequisites:

1. It is mandatory to have a Asana account.
2. You must have an OAuth app registered in Asana - https://asana.com/developers/documentation/getting-started/auth#register-an-app
